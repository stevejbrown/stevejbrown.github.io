I'm a PhD candidate in Materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara
with a passion for data science and machine learning. I am a big believer in the
scientific method and using data to both reveal underlying truths and make
decisions. You can find me on [github](https://github.com/stevejbrown) and
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brownstevej/). I can be reached at steve
[at] stevejbrown.com.

## Website

This website uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and was built on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). It
benefitted from tutorials by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and
[Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/).
