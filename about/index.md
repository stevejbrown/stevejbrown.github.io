I'm a PhD candidate in Materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara
where I study Fourier imaging and the optical properties of next generation
solar cell materials. I am a big believer in the scientific method and using
data to both reveal underlying truths and make decisions. I can be reached at

benefitted from tutorials by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and
